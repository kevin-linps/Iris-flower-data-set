## About this project

In this project, I explored the famous Iris Flower Data Set with classifiers in scikit-learn. First, I started by creating visuals of the data. Then, I trained models using Linear SVM and Decision Tree to classify the three flower species. The desciptions of the files in the respiratory  are as follows:

1. *Iris Flower Data Set 01 - Visualization*: building 2D and 3D scatter plots to visualize the relationships between each varaible in the data set
2. *Iris Flower Data Set 02 - Linear SVM*: training classifiers using LinearSVC in scikit-learn and evaluate their precision
3. *Iris Flower Data Set 03 - Decision Tree*: training classifiers using DecisionTreeClassifier in scikit-learn, evaluate their precision and produce a dichotomous key for the three iris species in the data set

## Technologies used

* Operating System: Windows 10
* Programs: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook
* Software: Python 3, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib
